# knowledge-base
That's my knowledge base -- which I hope, one day, be full of scientific data and solid data about the universe. 
I will store things here and create libraries with real world useful objects. Like console.log(apple.nutrients());
And the function will be also real world (and mathematical) application like function metricsToEmperial() { } and getMassGravity() { }.
